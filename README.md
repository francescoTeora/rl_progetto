# Reinforcement Learning Project
## Env
Some custom hoppers have been defined for the purpose of the project, including some environment that implement mass randomization.

## Training

The training code for reinforcement learning algorithms is available in the various files that starts with train, with different files for different algotirhms. Each file can be run individually to test specific configurations.

### Testing

By running the train files, various tests will be automatically executed to evaluate the performance of the implemented algorithms. Nevertheless, some specific tests can be done by adding a simple script, because models are available
